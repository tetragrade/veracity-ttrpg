			<h2>LIGHT SLOTS</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Certain kinds of ideas consume Light Slots: the usual three are Secrets, Ruses, and Stress. The example character has one of each, plus something less common.
					Click them to learn more.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2>INVENTORIES</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					The core of a Veracity character is their two slot-based inventories (Light + Flesh).
				</p>
				<p>
					You can have at most 18 Light & 18 Flesh slots.
					Characters start with 4 Flesh slots, 4 Light slots, and 4 slots to assign freely.
				</p>
				<p>
					Slots are unlocked from lowest to highest, but filled from highest to lowest, so that the empty slots are always continuous at the low numbers.
					You can rearrange items in slots freely, at any time. If your capacity is reduced i.e. an item is forcibly added or a slot is removed, you can choose the item that is removed.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="charsheet-info-secret" class="info-panel" hidden>
			<button>&times;</button>
			<h2>SECRETS</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					When your character hears something that sounds secret, you may add it as a Secret (with an appropriate description).
					Chose not to? your character didn't believe it, or considered it unimportant.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secrets must be the truth, and characters must have reasonable grounds to believe them.
					If something is known to be false, even <span class="pseudolink" title="known to the players, but not by the characters">metatextually</span>, it can't be a Secret.
				</p>
				<p>
					Revealing Secrets advances <span class="alignment">TRUTH</span>.
					When you shock at least one NPC by revealing a Secret, you level up: gain a Slot (Light or Flesh, your choice).
					An NPC that is both shocked and convinced is likely to become permanent ally or retainer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secrets are weapons against tricksters: revealing their Secrets inflicts Stress on them, and turns <span class="alignment">NEUTRAL</span> NPCs against them.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="charsheet-info-ruse" class="info-panel" hidden>
			<button>&times;</button>
			<h2>RUSES</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="quote">Don't get any ideas</p>
				<p>
					A Ruse represents a deliberate untruth that you're maintaining.
					Add it to a Light slot when you start to maintain the Lie, remove it when you stop.
					No slots? Tough luck.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="charsheet-info-stress" class="info-panel" hidden>
			<button>&times;</button>
			<h2>STRESS</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					You gain Stress for acting against a <a class="flash-facets-onclick" href="#mock-charsheet-facets">Facet</a>, or violating social <a class="flash-conventions-onclick" href="#conventions">Convention</a>. Enemies and hostile environments may also inflict Stress.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Remove one Stress each time you spend a full day relaxing in daylight.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If all of your Light Slots contain Stress, you Break: the first time, you <span class="underline">lose the ability to Level Up</span>.
					Each additional time, you gain d20 Wounds.
					After Breaking, remove all Stress.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="charsheet-info-path" class="info-panel" hidden>
			<button>&times;</button>
			<h2>OTHER ITEMS</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					All sorts of items enter into Light Slots.
					You might receive an idea as loot: from a conversation or book.
					Or suffer a harmful idea as a result of an attack from a foe.
				</p>
				<p>
					The example character is working on learning the Orcish tongue.
					The Referee has decided that it will require them to achieve a set of goals, and will fill a Light Slot until they're finished. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Referee is responsible for which ideas should be represented by items.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div id="charsheet-info-flesh" class="info-panel" hidden>
			<button>&times;</button>
			<h2>FLESH SLOTS</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Certain kinds of physical objects consume Flesh slots: the usual three are Evidence, Means, and Wounds. The example character has some of each.
					Click them to learn more.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other inconsequential things consume no slots: they should be bundled together as one Item, or handwaved.
				</p>

				<p>
					A Facet is a short phrase that describes your character's behaviour, it has an associated die size âˆˆ {d4, d6, d8 d10, d12}, corresponding to its intensity.
					Facets can be strengthened or weakened, gained or replaced. The Referee is responsible for determining how and when, though it should be infrequent.

			<h2>OTHER FEATURES</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Miscellaneous abilities are described in natural language under Other Features.

			<h2>HOW TO SAVE</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					When you attempt to do something for which the outcome is uncertain, the referee may call for a Save.
					Roll a d20, lower is better. The rules & referee may add a modifier to represent the difficulty of tasks.
					Calculate the total after modifiers: On a 0 or lower, you succeed. On an 19+ you fail. Otherwise, look at the corresponding slot:
				</p>
				<div id="charsheet-info-saves-branch-light-flesh" class="flex-horizontal">
					<div class="theme-light">If it takes mental effort, look at your Light.</div>
					<div class="theme-flesh">If it takes physical effort, look at your Flesh.</div>
				</div>
				<p class="centered">
					If the slot is empty, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail.

				</p>
				<p>

					Means always consume a Flesh Slot.
