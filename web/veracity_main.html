		<h1>VERACITY</h1>

		<div id="levelling-up">
			<h2>TELL THE TRUTH</h2>
			<p>
				In Veracity you play as an agent of <span class="alignment">TRUTH</span>.
				Each time you shock an NPC by exposing an agent of <span class="alignment">DECEIT</span>, you Level Up: gain an inventory slot, you choose which kind.
				<br>
				You can only expose any given scheme once, and each revelation must be greater than the last.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="your character">
			<div id="inventories">
				<H2>INVENTORIES</H2>
				All characters have two slot-based inventories (Light + Flesh). You can have at most 18 Light & 18 Flesh slots.
				<div>
					<p>Flesh slots are for physical objects.</p>
					
					<div id="item-evidence" class="item-flesh">
						<p class="item-header">Evidence: proof that deceit occurred.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="item-wound" class="item-flesh">
						<p class="item-header">Wounds: bodily damage</p>
						<p>
							Remove 1 Wound each time you spend a full day resting in a safe area with access to medical treatment.
							You die if all of your Flesh Slots contain Wounds.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="item-means" class="item-flesh">
						<p class="item-header">Means: treasure, large or unusual tools</p>
					</div>
				</div>
					
				<div>
					<p>Light slots are for mental objects.</p>
					<div id="item-secret" class="item-light">
						<p class="item-header" class="item-header">Secrets: lies, tricks, atoms of conspiracy</p>
						<p>
							When your character hears something that sounds secret, you may add it as a Secret (with an appropriate description). Chose not to? your character didn't believe it, or considered it unimportant.
							Revealing Secrets advances <span class="alignment">TRUTH</span>. They are weapons against tricksters: having your secret revealed inflicts Stress.
							Secrets must be the truth, and characters must have reasonable grounds to believe them. If something is known to be false, even metatextually, it can't be a Secret.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="item-stress" class="item-light">
						<p class="item-header" class="item-header">Stress: mental damage</p>
						<p>
							You gain Stress for acting against a <a name="facets"></a> or violating social <a name="convention">Convention</a>. Enemies and hostile environments may also inflict Stress.
							Remove 1 Stress each time you spend a full day relaxing in daylight.
							If all of your Light Slots contain Stress, you Break: the first time, you lose the ability to Level Up. Each additional time, you gain d20 Wounds.
							After Breaking, remove all Stress.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="item-ruse" class="item-light">
						<p class="item-header">Ruse: don't get any ideas</p>
						<p>
							A Ruse represents a deliberate untruth that you're maintaining.
							Add it to a Light slot when you start to maintain the Lie, remove it when you stop.
							No slots? Tough luck.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="item-much-much-more" class="item-light">
						<p class="item-header">And Much Much More</p>
						<p>
							There are other kinds of things. The Referee decides whether something fills a slot and what kind.
							The Referee might create different items i.e. in connection with a monster's special ability, or to provide character advancement.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			
				<p>
					Characters start with 4 Flesh slots, 4 Light slots, and 4 slots to assign freely.
					Unlock your slots from lowest to highest, but fill them from highest to lowest. Empty slots should always be continuous at the low numbers.
					You can rearrange items in slots freely, at any time. If your capacity is reduced i.e. an item is forcibly added or a slot is removed, you can choose the item that is removed.
					Other inconsequential things consume no slots: they should be bundled together as one Item, or handwaved.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="saving">
				<p>
					When you attempt to do something for which the outcome is uncertain, the referee may call for a Save.
					Roll a d20, lower is better. The rules & referee may add a modifier to represent the difficulty of tasks.
					Calculate the total after modifiers. On a 0 or lower, you succeed. On an 19+ you fail. Otherwise, look at the corresponding slot:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If it requires mental effort, look at your Light.</li>
					<li>If it requires physical effort, look at your Flesh.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If the slot is empty, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>FACETS</h2>
				<p>
					A Facet is a short phrase that describes your character's behaviour, it has an associated die size âˆˆ {d4, d6, d8 d10, d12}, corresponding to its intensity.
					Facets can be strengthened or weakened, lost, gained, or modified. The Referee is responsible for determining how and when.
