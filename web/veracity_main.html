			<h2>TELL THE TRUTH</h2>
			<p>
				In Veracity you play as an agent of <span class="alignment">TRUTH</span>.
				Each time you shock an NPC by exposing an agent of <span class="alignment">DECEIT</span>, you Level Up.
				You can only expose any given scheme once, and each revelation must be more shocking than the last.

				<H2>CHARACTER SHEET</H2>
				<p>
					Explore the interactive character sheet below, cick on a section to learn more.
				</p>
				<!-- TODO put this in the interactive sheet
					The core of a Veracity character is their two slot-based inventories (Light + Flesh). 	
					You can have at most 18 Light & 18 Flesh slots.

					Characters start with 4 Flesh slots, 4 Light slots, and 4 slots to assign freely.
					Unlock your slots from lowest to highest, but fill them from highest to lowest. Empty slots should always be continuous at the low numbers.
					You can rearrange items in slots freely, at any time. If your capacity is reduced i.e. an item is forcibly added or a slot is removed, you can choose the item that is removed.
					Other inconsequential things consume no slots: they should be bundled together as one Item, or handwaved.

				<h2>HOW TO SAVE</h2>
				<p>
					When you attempt to do something for which the outcome is uncertain, the referee may call for a Save.
					Roll a d20, lower is better. The rules & referee may add a modifier to represent the difficulty of tasks.
					Calculate the total after modifiers. On a 0 or lower, you succeed. On an 19+ you fail. Otherwise, look at the corresponding slot:

				<div class="flex-horizontal">
					<div>If it takes mental effort, look at your Light.</div>
					<div>If it takes physical effort, look at your Flesh.</div>

					If the slot is empty, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail.

				<h2>FACETS</h2>
				<p>
					A Facet is a short phrase that describes your character's behaviour, it has an associated die size ∈ {d4, d6, d8 d10, d12}, corresponding to its intensity.
					Facets can be strengthened or weakened, gained or replaced. The Referee is responsible for determining how and when, though it should be infrequent.
